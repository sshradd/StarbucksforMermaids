# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: Shraddha Subash

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Summary

Starbucks for Mermaids is an android app that was made for mermaids interested in more mermaid-like drinks.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üçπ üõçÔ∏è
